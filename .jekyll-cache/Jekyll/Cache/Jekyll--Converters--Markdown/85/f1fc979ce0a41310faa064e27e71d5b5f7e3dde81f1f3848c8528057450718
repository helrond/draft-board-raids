I"m<p><strong>This site began as an attempt to answer a simple question: How many draft board
raids were there?</strong></p>

<p>I quickly realized that, although a great deal of information about
draft board raids - which took place across the United States between 1968 and
1971 - has been published in a variety of sources (many of which are available on the
internet), understanding the full scope of these raids - or even answering basic
questions - is difficult because there is no source of structured data about
these actions.</p>

<p>This site attempts to fill that gap.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>As with any dataset, choices were made which impact the final product:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each location has been recorded as a separate action, including raids which
happened on the same date and were claimed by the same group.</li>
  <li>Not all fields are available for all actions. Generally speaking, the title,
date and general location (city and state) are available for each action,
but participant names and other data may not be.</li>
  <li>The sources cited are not intended to be comprehensive, but instead aim to
provide some evidentiary basis for claiming that a raid did, in fact, take place.</li>
</ul>
